Letâ€™s concentrate on the above packet fields (given above ).
5. Can you say whether the message corresponding to the above packet has been
fragmented?
answer 5. 
Yes, the message corresponding to the above packet has been fragmented. This is indicated by the presence of the "Fragmented IP protocol" information in the packet descriptions.

6. What information in the IP header indicates that the datagram been fragmented?
answer 6. 
Fragmentation Information in IP Header:
The following fields in the IP header provide information about fragmentation:
Flags: The Flags field contains information about fragmentation. In this case, the "More Fragments" flag is set, indicating that there are more fragments to follow.
Fragment Offset: The Fragment Offset field specifies the offset of the current fragment relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented datagram. In this case, the Fragment Offset is 0 for the first fragment.

7. What information in the IP header indicates whether this is the first fragment versus a
latter fragment?

answer 7.
The presence of the "More Fragments" flag being set in the Flags field indicates that this is not the last fragment of the original datagram.
Additionally, the Fragment Offset being 0 indicates that this is the first fragment. Subsequent fragments would have non-zero values in the Fragment Offset field to indicate their position relative to the original datagram.

5.  Fragmentation:

Yes, the message corresponding to the above packet has been fragmented. This is indicated by the presence of the "Fragmented IP protocol" information in the packet descriptions.

6.Fragmentation Information in IP Header:
The following fields in the IP header provide information about fragmentation:
Flags: The Flags field contains information about fragmentation. In this case, the "More Fragments" flag is set, indicating that there are more fragments to follow.
Fragment Offset: The Fragment Offset field specifies the offset of the current fragment relative to the beginning of the original unfragmented datagram. In this case, the Fragment Offset is 0 for the first fragment.

7. Indication of First Fragment vs. Later Fragment:
The presence of the "More Fragments" flag being set in the Flags field indicates that this is not the last fragment of the original datagram.
Additionally, the Fragment Offset being 0 indicates that this is the first fragment. Subsequent fragments would have non-zero values in the Fragment Offset field to indicate their position relative to the original datagram.


In summary:
5. Yes, the message has been fragmented.

The Flags field and the Fragment Offset field in the IP header indicate fragmentation.
The "More Fragments" flag being set and the Fragment Offset being 0 indicate that this is the first fragment of the datagram.
